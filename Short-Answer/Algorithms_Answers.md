#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) I would say 0(n) - Because we are incrementing a by n*n it reduces the a < n*n*n by 2 iterations


b) I had to google foo this one a bit, but the sources and I am going with it say O(n log n) it isn't linear because we are doubling j each time ... if we set n to 3 j becomes larger after two loops. 


c) 0(n) = I thought this was the easiest. It is recursive and we deincrement bunnies by 1 each ... so it is bascially one loop for bunnies.count ...

## Exercise II

Do a Binary Search. 

Walk half way up the building and drop an egg (break in relation to floor) ... if less divide the remaining floors // by 2 and drop again ... repeat. Same if higher. 

Divide and Conquer approach so O(log n)



Examples like this make is sooooooo much easier for me to understand these concepts, by the way. :D
